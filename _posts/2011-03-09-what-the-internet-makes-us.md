# The power of the bad is strong and I feel like there are dark forces at work to make it even more powerful. Those dark forces come in form of services like facebook.

## We become addicted to these services, spending hours a day on them. Reading up to see what people are saying, maybe they might mention our name. Maybe we can add a funny comment on their post. Maybe that old girlfriend will think you're still cool. Oh you're at a concert, better take a picture to prove that you were there and post it to facebook. Night out with friends? Take a picture and post it to twitter.

# It doesn't matter, it adds noise into our lives and is bringing us down.

<h1 id="enjoy">Enjoy those moments you have, be in them fully.</h1>

# Spend your time on the computer doing good, something you can walk away from and feel satisfied about.

## We all need our downtime, don't get me wrong. But in some ways it feels like we're moving towards more downtime than uptime. Instead of 50/50 or 60/40, maybe aim for 80/20 good to bad.
